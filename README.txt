Educational Goals

This Deal or No Deal project provides the opportunity to a majority of the concepts covered in class. (A list is provided below.) By culuminating all these concepts into one large project, students will have the ability to visualize how numerous moving parts work together to fit in a single functioning project; it speaks to the cumulative nature of computer science and how many concepts are dependent on each other and shows the power of being able to utilize them together rather than independently. Furthermore, concepts such as "mutability" which may be seen as a nuisance in lecture and exams will have the opportunity to shine as this project shows the effect of mutable vs immutable data types and how code has to be written differently (some cases for the better, some cases for the worse) as a result of this property.

List of Topics Covered:
- Input & Output
- Decision
- Loops
- Functions
- Files
- String Formatting
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Mutability 

In addition to the concepts listed above, this project provides an excellent opportunity to improve debugging skills. Given the nature of a large project and very detailed specifications, bugs are bound to happen; having the opportunity to work through a non-trivial bug is essential in the early stages of computer science as it is preparation for what is bound to happen in the future. Furthermore, this project has the ability to emphasize the use of documentation (with the random library), which is a valuable skill in the computer science industry as one cannot possibly memorize every possible function. 

(Note: Due to the circumstances that have recently arisen regarding academic dishonesty and online learning, it may be more wise to make this project more abstract; while this will help make cheating more evident, it will also emphasize the skill of breaking down the abstraction of a program to pseudocode before the actual implementation, which is an essential skill for any project in general. The startRound() function was left in an open-ended manner to emphasize abstraction; the rest of the project, though, is very outlined.)
