# Deal or No Deal

Deal or No Deal is a game show where a lucky player will get the chance to win a cash prize as large as $1,000,000. The game starts when the contestants selects 1 of the 26 cases, each holding a random cash value between $0.01 and $1,000,000. Then, the contestant will open a fixed amount of cases (depending on the round). After all the contestant has opened all the cases for the round, the banker will give the player a cash offer to buy their case. At this point, the player can sell their case for the amount the banker offered, or decline the offer and open several more cases. This will continue until there are two cases left. If an offer is declined when there are two cases left, then the contestant may choose to keep their case or swap their case with the other one remaining. The contestant wins the amount of money inside the case.
